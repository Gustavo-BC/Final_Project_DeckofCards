# Final_Project_DeckofCards

## Description

This final project allows a user to create a deck of cards and call methods on the deck to shuffle and/or draw.

## Usage

An example for how to use this project would be

```
deck = Deck.new # this creates a new deck that will have an array with 52 cards and assign it to deck
deck.cards # this will return an array with all the cards
deck.shuffle # this will shuffle the cards in the array
deck.draw # this will draw a card from the deck thus making the array have one less card
```
